# Project Proposal for CS445

## Introduction

Our team is currently planning on implementing a neural network for the project. This neural network will be implemented similarly to one of the implementations of neural networks done in CS 445. The group is also considering utilizing the Pytorch framework to build a different neural network.
Data Set

### Project Type

Currently there are no concrete plans on utilizing a specific data set on stock trends. However, the group feels confident in the availability of various data spread throughout many stock market websites. The main focus on specific data types will consist of stock market price trends, analyzing data trends for major conglomerations of companies. Perhaps as an entertaining gimmick to the project, the group will analyze stock market trends for toilet paper manufacturers and hand sanitizer companies trends.

### Testing

For testing, the group will create a testing suite managing fold partitioning, number of epochs, learning rate, hidden layer structure, number of hidden units, number of weights, etc, and will be putting said variables and their results into dataframes which will be discussed extensively at the end of the experimentation phase of the project.

## Methods
 ### Project Theme/Description

The main goal of this project will be to utilize a neural network structure in order to analyze complicated stock market trends in order to predict future market values and provide a possible stock correction. The group was inspired to pursue this theme due to the current extraordinary state of the stock market, and the impact COVID-19 has had on the global economy.
Methods to be used

The group will use methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, and will utilize tests such as a linear model in order to establish a baseline frame of reference for accuracy analysis.

### Sources of Code and Data

For sources of Data, refer to 'Data Set' section in the Introduction. The main source of the neural network will consist of CS 445 presentations done by Doctor Anderson, and perhaps will consist of the pytorch framework additions into the source code of which the group is unsure of currently.

### Division of work between teammates

The group will establish a github repository for managing various files of code such as the file for the neural network itself, the testing suite file for various tests we will conduct, as well as the jupyter notebook which will import both the neural network class and the testing suite class, and conduct indepth analysis while describing our experiment and our final results.

The team will utilize pair programming when setting up the baseline structure of our repository, and will conduct an Agile style of sprint planning where the total workload for this project will be divided into multiple issues and suites of issues to be distributed and completed equally among the members.

Once all the individual issues have been covered and merged together by the teammates, the group will come together to write any conclusions as well as experiment findings about the project.

### Possible Results

The team is expecting there to be varied and extraordinary results unlike the standard healthy economic trends, due to the very serious outbreak of the Corona Virus. To be more specific, the team believes that the trends of non essential production or research will be a lot more stunted compared to a healthy economic state, whereas the more essential production such as toilet paper and sanitizer will be inflated.

### Timeline
 #### Set up the Github Repository: April 20
 #### Finish Neural Network Source Code: April 27/28/29
 #### Complete testing suite and the tests which will be conducted inside the Jupyter Notebook: May 4
 #### Finish Jupyter Notebook Report: May 11
